# 概述

该项目是一个开发者与测试人员的的协同平台。项目线上地址[http://81.68.254.93:999](http://81.68.254.93:999)，目前项目没有做移动端适配，请用pc预览项目。

## 技术栈

该项目使用webpack构建react应用，语言使用typescript，封装fetch和常用组件，确保你的电脑拥有nodejs环境。

### `npm install`

安装应用必要依赖

### `npm start`

启动项目

### `npm run build`

打包项目

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it
